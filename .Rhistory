A science table plot can illustrate a variety of hypothetical models for treatment response, graphically depicting different forms of treatment effect heterogeneity.  A few examples are shown in Figure 2.  Multiplicative effects (Figure 2A) and tobit effects (Figure 2E) are two other treatment effect models occaisionally discussed in the literature.  Many discussions of treatment effect heterogeneity center on the hypothesis that treatment response correllates in some way with the control potential outcome, $Y(0)$: Perhaps "healthy" individuals with higher $Y(0)$ have a greater treatment response (Figure 2B), or perhaps "sicker" individuals with lower $Y(0)$ stand to gain more from treatment (Figure 2C).  In other scenarios, one might suggest that there is a "sweet spot" for treatment, perhaps representing individuals who have intermediate potential outcomes (Figure 2D).

A science table plot can illustrate a variety of hypothetical models for treatment response, graphically depicting different forms of treatment effect heterogeneity.  A few examples are shown in Figure 2.  Multiplicative effects (Figure 2A) and tobit effects (Figure 2E) are two other treatment effect models occaisionally discussed in the literature.  Many discussions of treatment effect heterogeneity center on the hypothesis that treatment response correllates in some way with the control potential outcome, $Y(0)$: Perhaps "healthy" individuals with higher $Y(0)$ have a greater treatment response (Figure 2B), or perhaps "sicker" individuals with lower $Y(0)$ stand to gain more from treatment (Figure 2C).  In other scenarios, one might suggest that there is a "sweet spot" for treatment, perhaps representing individuals who have intermediate potential outcomes (Figure 2D).
